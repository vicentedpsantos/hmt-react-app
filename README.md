# Usage

This project is, at the time of this README, deployed [here](https://hardcore-tesla-72d935.netlify.app/).

# Using locally

If you wish to run this locally, follow these steps:
- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn start`

In the [htm-chrome-plugin](https://github.com/vicentedpsantos/hmt-chrome-plugin) project, assign `localhost:3000` to the `reactAppUrl` variable in the file myApp.js at line 6. After making this change, follow the steps described in the plugin's `README.md` to get set up with it as well.

# Templates

This app is being run with hardcoded templates ([see here](https://github.com/vicentedpsantos/hmt-react-app)), but you can choose to fetch those from your own server or start storing those in the user's localStorage.
